11/8/2019 - Version 1.2
----------------------------------------------------------
- Changes and Additions:

    - Added scaling option (0.5 - 1.0) for MAST GUI
      buttons located in Settings under the GUI tab

    - Added tooltips to Draw Single, Draw Continuous,
      Paint Area, Randomizer, and Eraser

    - Replaced each method that loaded from the selected
      folder, with a folder select dialog window

    - Grid Unit Size has been split into x/z and y, and
      renamed to "XZ Unit Size" and "Y Unit Size"

    - Randomizer Changes:

        - Added "replaceable" to the MAST Component Script
            - Randomly replaces currently selected prefab
              with another in the same category

        - Replaced rotate x, y, and z bools with x, y,
          and z floats
            - Set to zero for no rotation, otherwise it
              will use the value as a rotation factor/step
                - (ie. A value of 45 randomly chooses
                   0, 45, 90, 135, 180, 225, 270, or 315)

    - Removed custom inspector for MAST prefab component
      scripts
        - It was not allowing the same value to be
          modified over multiple prefabs at the same time
        - Formatted the actual MAST prefab component
          script to have headers and spacing

    - Renamed and rearranged MAST scripts in an attempt
      to apply some logic to a chaotic situation


- Bug Fixes:

    - MAST no longer causes project build errors

    - Palette no longer loses the column count when
      returning from fullscreen or playing

    - Snapshot Camera now pulls back properly to take
      pictures of prefabs without colliders

    - Eraser tool no longer deletes the top parent
      GameObject if the prefab parent contains a collider

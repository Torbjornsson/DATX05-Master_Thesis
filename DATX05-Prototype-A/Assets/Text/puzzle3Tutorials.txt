Scan one side of the cube
by placing it above the
scanner to your right.


Try scanning a side of
the cube!;

The 6 lights on the scanner
corresponds to each side of
the cube. Every time you
scan a side correctly, one
light will turn on.


Try scanning the displayed
side 2 times!;

But if you make a mistake,
all the lights will turn
off again, and you have to
start over.


Try scanning any side of
the cube, until all the
lights are off again!;

The goal of this puzzle
is to turn on all of the
lights! In order to do so,
you must scan each of the
cube's sides the right
times, in the right order.

Use this legend to figure
out in what order to scan.

When all lights are on,
put the cube in the slot
to your left!
